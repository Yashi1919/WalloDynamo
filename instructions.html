        <h1>App Usage Instructions</h1>

        <h2>1. Put the App in the Background</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure that our app runs smoothly and continues to function properly, please lock it in memory by putting it in the background. 
            This allows the app to remain active and perform its tasks without interruption.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the app is closed completely, it may lose important data or not work as intended when you return. Keeping it in the background ensures that you have a seamless experience and can quickly resume where you left off.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No Restrictions in Battery Saver</h2>
        <p>
            To optimize the app's performance, please ensure there are no restrictions when your device is in battery saver mode. The app is designed to use a maximum of only 2-3% of your battery per day, so it won't significantly impact your device's battery life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Allowing the app to run without restrictions ensures it can perform background tasks and deliver notifications as intended. This way, you won't miss important updates or features while saving battery.
        </p>
