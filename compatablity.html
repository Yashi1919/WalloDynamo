        <h1>Compatibility Information</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: 25-9-2024</p>

        <h2>Important Compatibility Notice</h2>
        <p>We want to inform our users that the Wallodynamoright app is currently not compatible with Android 14 (also known as Android 34). This incompatibility is primarily due to the new foreground service policy introduced in this version of Android.</p>

        <h2>Reason for Incompatibility</h2>
        <p>The new foreground service policy implemented in Android 14 restricts how apps can run services in the background. This change can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes in our app. Some specific issues you may encounter include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inability to run the app in the background as intended.</li>
            <li>Frequent crashes or forced closures when trying to use the app.</li>
            <li>Limited functionality compared to previous Android versions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advice for Users</h2>
        <p>If you are using Android 14, we recommend  installing from our webbsite,No need to worry about privacy concerns even if you install from here google play automatically scans the app We are actively working on a solution and will notify users as soon as the app is compatible with Android 14.</p>
